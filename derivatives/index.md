# Derivatives Index (Non-Canonical)

This index provides an **orientation map** of derivative artifacts related to the System Momentum Canon.

This document is **non-canonical**.
It introduces no meaning and confers no authority.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this index is to:

- make derivative spaces discoverable
- clarify scope boundaries
- prevent confusion between Canon and derivatives
- support navigation without interpretation

This index does not define hierarchy or priority.

---

## Derivative Spaces

### Institutional Realization

- `institutional-realization/README.md`
- `institutional-realization/principles.md`
- `institutional-realization/failure-modes.md`

Scope:
Concrete, contextual, and plural instantiations constrained by the Canon.

---

### Validation Service

- `validation-service/README.md`

Scope:
Evidence-based, mechanical checks for formally checkable claims.
No approval, no certification.

---

### Agentic Systems

- `agentic-systems/README.md`

Scope:
Safe reference patterns for agents interacting with the Canon.
Prevention of instrumentalization and authority laundering.

---

### Editorial Systems

- `editorial-systems/README.md`

Scope:
Guidance for editorial and media systems referencing the Canon
without legitimization or endorsement.

---

## Non-Exhaustive

This index is intentionally incomplete.

Additional derivative spaces may be added without:

- canonical impact
- hierarchical implication
- governance escalation

---

## Separation Guarantee

Presence in this index does not imply:

- endorsement
- recommendation
- correctness
- canonical relevance

It indicates only existence.

---

## Status

This index may evolve.

Such evolution has no effect on canonical meaning.
