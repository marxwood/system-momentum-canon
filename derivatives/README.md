# Derivative Space (Non-Canonical)

This directory contains **derivative artifacts** related to the System Momentum Canon.

All contents here are **non-canonical**.
They introduce no canonical meaning and hold no authority over `canon/`.

---

## Purpose of Derivatives

Derivatives exist to:

- explore applications constrained by the Canon
- experiment with realizations without altering truth
- document interpretations without authority
- fail safely without damaging the Canon

Derivatives are optional.
The Canon does not depend on them.

---

## Non-Equivalence

No derivative is equivalent to the Canon.

Derivatives must not:

- replace canonical text
- summarize the Canon as authority
- present themselves as “the Canon in practice”
- claim canonical legitimacy

Reference does not imply equivalence.

---

## Responsibility and Ownership

Each derivative:

- declares its authorship
- carries its own responsibility
- states its scope and limitations
- accepts the consequences of misuse

Responsibility does not transfer to the Canon.

---

## Referencing Rules

Derivatives may reference the Canon only by:

- explicit file paths
- specific sections
- commit hashes or release tags

Generic references to “the Canon” are invalid.

---

## Failure Tolerance

Derivatives may:

- contradict each other
- become obsolete
- be abandoned

Such outcomes do not affect the Canon.

---

## Separation Guarantee

Changes within `derivatives/`:

- do not modify canonical meaning
- do not trigger canonical revision
- do not require canonical approval

Derivative space is intentionally porous.

---

## Status

Derivative space is open-ended.

Its contents may evolve freely.
Such evolution has no canonical effect.
