# Editorial Systems (Derivative, Non-Canonical)

This directory contains derivative guidance for **editorial and media systems** that reference the System Momentum Canon.

This content is **non-canonical**.
It introduces no canonical meaning and confers no authority.

---

## Purpose

This derivative exists to:

- prevent use of the Canon as editorial authority
- constrain rhetorical and narrative misuse
- enable transparent reference without legitimization
- separate reporting from validation

It governs usage patterns, not editorial judgment.

---

## Canon Is Not an Editorial Standard

The Canon must not be treated as:

- an editorial policy
- a truth arbiter
- a correctness standard
- a narrative validator

Editorial standards remain external.

---

## Permitted Editorial References

Editorial systems may:

- reference the Canon as a constraint framework
- quote canonical text with full context and citation
- disclose non-canonical status explicitly
- surface disagreement or uncertainty

Reference must be descriptive, not prescriptive.

---

## Prohibited Editorial Uses

Editorial systems must not:

- present Canon alignment as legitimacy
- imply approval or endorsement
- use Canon citation to close debate
- frame narratives as “Canon-compliant”
- rank positions by canonical purity

Such uses constitute authority laundering.

---

## Separation of Reporting and Validation

Reporting on Canon usage must be separated from validation claims.

Editorial content:

- may describe claims made by others
- must not validate those claims
- must not act as a gatekeeper

Description is not endorsement.

---

## Disclosure Requirements

Editorial references must disclose:

- who is making the claim
- scope and limitations of the reference
- absence of canonical authority

Omission that implies authority is invalid.

---

## Handling Disputes

When disputes arise involving Canon reference:

- present competing claims explicitly
- avoid interpretive resolution
- avoid canonical arbitration

Dispute resolution remains external.

---

## Failure and Misuse

Editorial misuse of the Canon:

- does not affect canonical meaning
- may mislead audiences
- invalidates the editorial claim

Responsibility remains with the publisher.

---

## Status

This derivative is optional.

Multiple editorial approaches may coexist.
Their credibility is external to the Canon.
