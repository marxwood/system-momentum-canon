# Failure Modes of Institutional Realization

(Non-Canonical, Derivative)

This document catalogs **common failure modes** observed in institutional realizations constrained by the System Momentum Canon.

This document is **non-canonical**.
It is descriptive, not normative.
It introduces no authority.

---

## Purpose

To enable:

- early detection of institutional degradation
- post-mortem analysis without blame laundering
- comparison across different realizations

This catalog does not prescribe remedies.

---

## Failure Mode: Authority Accretion

Institutions gradually accumulate authority beyond their initial scope.

Indicators include:

- expansion of mandate
- informal decision centers
- dependency creation
- resistance to oversight

This failure often presents as “efficiency.”

---

## Failure Mode: Responsibility Diffusion

Responsibility becomes abstracted or distributed to the point of disappearance.

Indicators include:

- committee decisions without owners
- procedural blame shifting
- invocation of systems or rules as actors

Diffuse responsibility prevents correction.

---

## Failure Mode: Canon Laundering

The Canon is cited to legitimize institutional actions.

Indicators include:

- selective quotation
- claims of alignment as justification
- invocation of Canon to silence dissent

This directly violates canonical intent.

---

## Failure Mode: Compliance Theater

Institutions simulate alignment without structural change.

Indicators include:

- ritualized reviews
- checklists and badges
- symbolic language adoption

Appearance replaces substance.

---

## Failure Mode: Irreversibility Lock-In

Institutional structures become difficult or impossible to dismantle.

Indicators include:

- legal or technical lock-in
- economic dependencies
- absence of exit paths

Irreversibility precedes capture.

---

## Failure Mode: Drift Normalization

Gradual deviation becomes accepted as normal.

Indicators include:

- repeated “temporary” exceptions
- tolerance of minor violations
- erosion of original constraints

Drift rarely triggers alarms.

---

## Failure Mode: Externalization of Harm

Negative effects are displaced outside institutional boundaries.

Indicators include:

- cost shifting to unrepresented groups
- denial of responsibility for downstream effects
- framing harm as externality

Unowned harm accumulates.

---

## Failure Mode: Interpretive Closure

Institutions claim interpretive authority.

Indicators include:

- “official readings”
- suppression of alternative analysis
- epistemic gatekeeping

Closure replaces learning.

---

## Status

This catalog is incomplete by design.

Additional failure modes may be documented without canonical impact.
