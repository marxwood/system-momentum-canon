# Institutional Realization (Derivative, Non-Canonical)

This directory contains derivative work related to **Institutional Realization** under the constraints of the System Momentum Canon.

This content is **non-canonical**.
It introduces no canonical meaning and has no authority over `canon/`.

## What Institutional Realization Is

Institutional Realization refers to the **concrete instantiation** of ideas constrained by the Canon within real institutions.

It is:

- contextual
- historical
- political
- contingent
- reversible

No institutional realization is final.

---

## What Institutional Realization Is Not

Institutional Realization is not:

- a canonical extension
- a prescribed model
- a recommended structure
- a normative blueprint
- a universal solution

There is no “correct” institutional realization.

---

## Plurality by Design

Multiple institutional realizations may coexist.

They may:

- differ radically
- contradict each other
- succeed or fail
- evolve independently

Such plurality is expected and necessary.

---

## Constraint Relationship

Institutional realizations are constrained by the Canon.

This means:

- they must not violate canonical non-negotiables
- they must not claim canonical authority
- they must not externalize responsibility to the Canon

Constraint does not imply endorsement.

---

## Responsibility and Accountability

All responsibility for institutional realizations remains with their creators and operators.

The Canon:

- does not authorize institutions
- does not legitimize power
- does not excuse harm
- does not absorb failure

Responsibility is local and explicit.

---

## Evaluation Criteria (Non-Canonical)

Institutional realizations may be evaluated using external criteria such as:

- effectiveness
- legitimacy
- justice
- sustainability
- social impact

Such evaluations are **outside** the Canon.

---

## Failure as Signal

Failure of an institutional realization:

- does not invalidate the Canon
- does not require canonical revision
- provides information for future derivatives

Failure is a property of institutions, not truth.

---

## Status

This derivative space is open.

Additional documents may be added here without canonical impact.
