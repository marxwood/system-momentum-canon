# Principles for Observing Institutional Realization

(Non-Canonical, Derivative)

This document defines **non-normative principles** for observing and reasoning about institutional realizations constrained by the System Momentum Canon.

This document is **non-canonical**.
It prescribes nothing.
It confers no authority.

---

## Purpose

These principles exist to:

- support analysis without prescription
- prevent premature normativity
- avoid canonization of institutions
- enable comparison without endorsement

They are lenses, not rules.

---

## Principle of Contextual Dependence

Every institutional realization is dependent on context.

Context includes:

- historical moment
- cultural environment
- power distribution
- economic conditions
- technological constraints

No realization is portable without distortion.

---

## Principle of Power Visibility

Power must remain visible.

Institutional realizations should be observed for:

- where power accumulates
- how decisions are enforced
- who benefits from structure
- who bears consequences

Invisible power signals instability.

---

## Principle of Responsibility Localization

Responsibility must be local and explicit.

Valid realizations:

- name decision-makers
- expose accountability paths
- avoid abstraction of blame

Responsibility must not be externalized to the Canon.

---

## Principle of Reversibility

Institutions should be evaluated for reversibility.

Indicators include:

- ability to dismantle without collapse
- absence of irreversible commitments
- clear exit paths

Irreversible institutions tend toward capture.

---

## Principle of Failure Containment

Failure should be containable.

Observation focuses on:

- blast radius of failure
- spillover effects
- systemic fragility

Failure that propagates uncontrollably is a warning signal.

---

## Principle of Drift Detection

Drift is expected and must be observable.

Drift includes:

- gradual power consolidation
- expansion of scope
- normalization of exceptions

Undetected drift precedes institutional failure.

---

## Principle of Non-Endorsement

Observation does not imply endorsement.

Describing an institution:

- does not legitimize it
- does not justify it
- does not recommend it

Analysis must remain separate from advocacy.

---

## Status

These principles are optional.

They may evolve or be discarded without canonical impact.
