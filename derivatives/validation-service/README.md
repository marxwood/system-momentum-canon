# Validation Service (Derivative, Non-Canonical)

This directory describes a **validation service** as a derivative artifact related to the System Momentum Canon.

This content is **non-canonical**.
It introduces no canonical meaning and holds no authority.

---

## Purpose

The validation service exists to:

- provide **evidence-based checks** against explicitly formalizable constraints
- increase transparency of self-asserted alignment claims
- reduce ambiguity in public communication

It does not validate truth.
It does not validate intent.
It does not validate alignment.

---

## Nature of Validation

Validation performed by this service is:

- mechanical
- scoped
- explicit
- reproducible

Validation is limited to what is **formally checkable**.

---

## What the Service Can Check

Examples of checkable elements include:

- presence of required canonical references
- correct citation format (file + commit or tag)
- explicit disclosure statements
- absence of prohibited validation language

These checks are illustrative, not exhaustive.

---

## What the Service Cannot Check

The service cannot determine:

- correctness of interpretation
- moral or ethical validity
- intent or good faith
- completeness of alignment
- absence of misuse

Such determinations remain external.

---

## Output Characteristics

Service output must:

- state **PASS / FAIL / UNKNOWN** per check
- list checks performed
- list checks not performed
- include rule version or hash
- avoid aggregate scoring

Outputs are evidence, not endorsements.

---

## No Authority Transfer

The validation service:

- does not approve
- does not certify
- does not authorize
- does not gate access

It must not be presented as Canon-backed.

---

## Public Endpoint Rules

If exposed publicly, the service must:

- disclose non-canonical status
- disclaim approval or certification
- publish scope and limitations
- avoid branding implying authority

The endpoint is informational only.

---

## Failure and Misuse

Failure of validation:

- does not invalidate the Canon
- does not imply non-alignment
- indicates only that specific checks did not pass

Misuse of validation output invalidates the claim.

---

## Status

This derivative is optional.

Multiple validation services may exist.
They may differ without canonical impact.
