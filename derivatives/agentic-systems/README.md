# Agentic Systems (Derivative, Non-Canonical)

This directory contains derivative guidance for **agentic systems** that reference the System Momentum Canon.

This content is **non-canonical**.
It introduces no canonical meaning and confers no authority.

---

## Purpose

This derivative exists to:

- prevent instrumentalization of the Canon by agents
- clarify safe reference patterns
- document prohibited agent behaviors
- enable experimentation without authority transfer

It constrains usage patterns, not outcomes.

---

## Canon as Constraint, Not Objective

Agentic systems must not treat the Canon as:

- an objective function
- a reward signal
- a policy
- an optimization target

The Canon constrains invalid structures.
It does not drive behavior.

---

## Permitted Agent References

Agents may:

- reference canonical constraints explicitly
- check for prohibited patterns
- surface uncertainty where Canon is silent
- defer decisions when constraints are violated

Reference is evaluative, not generative.

---

## Prohibited Agent Behaviors

Agents must not:

- optimize for “Canon alignment”
- rank actions by perceived canonical purity
- justify actions by Canon citation
- silence alternatives via Canon reference
- claim canonical authority

Such behaviors constitute misuse.

---

## Decision and Responsibility

All decisions remain external to agents and the Canon.

Agents:

- may flag constraint violations
- must not choose on behalf of humans or institutions
- must not externalize responsibility

“Agent decided due to the Canon” is invalid.

---

## Handling Uncertainty

When the Canon is silent or ambiguous, agents must:

- explicitly state uncertainty
- avoid inferred permissions or prohibitions
- defer to external judgment

Uncertainty must not be resolved internally.

---

## Logging and Transparency

Agent interactions with the Canon should be:

- logged
- inspectable
- reproducible

Logs are evidence, not validation.

---

## Failure and Containment

Agent failure:

- does not affect the Canon
- must be contained locally
- must not propagate authority claims

Failure is an agent property, not a canonical one.

---

## Status

This derivative is optional.

Multiple agentic approaches may coexist.
Their success or failure has no canonical impact.
