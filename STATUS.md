# Status: Defined / Unstable

This repository contains the **System Momentum Canon**.

The Canon’s **core definition for v0.1 is complete**.
Its structure, hierarchy, terminology, axioms, constraints, and non-negotiables are defined.

The Canon is **defined**, but **not yet stable**.

---

## Current State

- Version: **v0.1**
- Definition: **Complete**
- Stability: **Unstable**
- Change frequency: **Medium**
- Authority: **Single-custodian canonical control**
- Intended audience: **System architects and agents operating under explicit constraint**

---

## What Is Complete in v0.1

The following elements are complete and binding for v0.1:

- Canonical hierarchy
- Scope and non-goals
- Definitions
- Axioms
- Constraints
- Non-negotiables
- Authority model

Together, these define the **canonical core**.

---

## What Is Not Complete

The following are explicitly **out of scope for v0.1**:

- Stability guarantees
- Institutional governance beyond authority definition
- Change cadence or release policy
- Formal compliance mechanisms
- Derivative specifications or implementations

Absence of these elements does **not** weaken canonical validity.

---

## Usage Restrictions

Until stability is explicitly declared:

- The Canon **MUST NOT** be treated as stable.
- Implementations **MAY** reference the Canon, but **MUST** accept breaking change risk.
- No institution or product may claim certified or final alignment.
- Canonical meaning **MUST NOT** be inferred beyond what is explicitly defined.

---

## Change Policy (v0.1)

- All changes are explicit.
- Backward compatibility is **not guaranteed**.
- Canonical meaning may still shift to remove ambiguity or inconsistency.
- No silent evolution is permitted.

---

## Stability Declaration

Stability will be declared explicitly in this file.
