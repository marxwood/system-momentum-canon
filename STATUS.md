# Status: Draft / Unstable

This repository contains the **System Momentum Canon** in its formative stage.

The Canon is **not complete**, **not stable**, and **not ready** to be used as:

- an implementation reference
- a product specification
- a governance framework
- a whitepaper or public manifesto

## Current State

- Version: v0.1 (in progress)
- Stability: **Unstable**
- Change frequency: **High**
- Authority: **Single-author canonical control**
- Intended audience: **System architects and agents operating under explicit constraint**

## Usage Restrictions

Until an explicit stability declaration is made:

- The Canon **MUST NOT** be treated as normative guidance for implementations.
- The Canon **MUST NOT** be cited as a finished or authoritative system.
- No derivative documents (whitepapers, products, institutions) may claim compliance.
- No part of the Canon may be selectively quoted to justify decisions.

Any such use constitutes **misrepresentation**.

## Intent

The purpose of this phase is to:

- define invariants
- establish non-negotiable constraints
- prevent premature institutionalization
- protect the Canon from dilution or instrumentalization

Stability will be declared explicitly.
Silence does **not** imply readiness.
