# System Momentum Canon

This repository contains the **System Momentum Canon**.

The Canon defines **structural validity** through invariants, constraints, and prohibitions.
It does not prescribe implementations or operational behavior.

---

## What This Repository Is

- An authoritative reference for canonical structure
- A boundary definition for validity
- A constraint system for systems, institutions, and agents

---

## What This Repository Is Not

- A product specification
- A framework or toolkit
- A governance manual
- A strategy or roadmap
- A consensus document

---

## How to Read the Canon

The Canon must be read **top-down**:

1. `canon/00-preamble.md`
2. `canon/01-canonical-hierarchy.md`
3. `canon/02-scope-and-non-goals.md`
4. `canon/03-definitions.md`
5. `canon/04-axioms.md`
6. `canon/05-constraints.md`
7. `canon/06-non-negotiables.md`

Governance documents apply after canonical structure is understood.

---

## Authority

Canonical authority is defined in:

- `governance/authority.md`

Change control is defined in:

- `governance/change-policy.md`

---

## Status

Current canonical status is defined in:

- `STATUS.md`

Version snapshots are recorded in:

- `versions/`

---

## Usage

The Canon defines validity.
It does not compel adoption.

Derivative artifacts may reference the Canon.
They may not redefine it.

---

## Warning

Misuse of the Canon can cause structural damage.

The Canon must not be used to:

- justify authority
- replace judgment
- legitimize outcomes

It exists to constrain, not to empower.
