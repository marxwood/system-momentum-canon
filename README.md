# System Momentum Canon

This repository contains the **System Momentum Canon**.

The Canon defines **structural validity** through invariants, constraints, and prohibitions.
It does not prescribe implementations, decisions, intelligence, enforcement, or morality.

---

## What This Repository Is

---

## What This Repository Is Not

- A decision engine or recommendation system
- An intelligence or reasoning system
- A moral or ideological authority

This README does **not** define canonical order and must not be used for navigation.

- Change control: `governance/change-policy.md`

---

## Status and Versions

## Usage

The Canon defines validity.
It does not compel adoption.

Derivative artifacts may reference the Canon.
They may not redefine it.

## Warning

Misuse of the Canon can cause structural damage.

The Canon must not be used to:

- justify authority
- replace judgment
- legitimize outcomes

It exists to constrain, not to empower.
