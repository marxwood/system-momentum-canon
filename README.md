# System Momentum Canon

This repository contains the **canonical foundations** of the System Momentum architecture.

The Canon defines:

- invariant principles
- non-negotiable constraints
- prohibited patterns
- the separation between core truths and their institutional or technical realizations

The Canon is **not**:

- a product specification
- a framework or SDK
- an implementation guide
- a whitepaper or manifesto

It exists to establish **hard boundaries** within which systems, agents, and institutions may operate.

## How to Read This Repository

- The `canon/` directory contains the normative core.
- The order of documents is intentional and binding.
- No section may be interpreted in isolation.
- Silence is not permission.

## Authority and Change

The Canon is maintained under explicit authority.
Changes are intentional, traceable, and constrained.

See `STATUS.md` and `governance/` for current state and change rules.
