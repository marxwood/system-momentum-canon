# System Momentum Canon — Coverage Map (Non-Canonical)

This document provides a **conceptual map** of the areas covered by the System Momentum Canon.

This document is **not canonical**.
It introduces no rules, constraints, or authority.
It exists solely for orientation.

Canonical meaning is defined only by documents listed in `canon/INDEX.md`.

---

## Purpose of This Map

The purpose of this map is to:

- make the Canon navigable as a system
- clarify what problem spaces are intentionally covered
- show how individual canonical documents relate conceptually
- prevent misinterpretation of scope and intent

This map does **not** define reading order.
It does **not** define priority.
It does **not** define completeness.

---

## Canonical Coverage Areas

### I. Ontological Core

Defines what the Canon _is_, what it _constrains_, and what it _cannot be_.

Covers:

- existence and purpose of the Canon
- hierarchy and directionality
- definitions and axioms
- constraints and non-negotiables

This is the structural spine.
Without it, nothing else holds.

---

### II. External Misuse Prevention

Protects the Canon from external capture and instrumentalization.

Addresses misuse such as:

- alignment as branding
- institutional ownership claims
- interpretive authority grabs
- exception laundering
- enforcement illusions

These documents prevent the Canon from becoming a tool of power.

---

### III. Internal Misuse Prevention

Protects the Canon from well-intentioned but destructive internal use.

Addresses misuse such as:

- responsibility transfer
- decision outsourcing
- treating the Canon as intelligence
- agentic optimization for alignment
- moral absolutism

These failures typically emerge from “correct” intentions.

---

### IV. Epistemological Limits

Defines what the Canon does **not** know, assert, or decide.

Clarifies:

- intentional incompleteness
- meaning of silence
- absence of claims
- lack of factual, predictive, or epistemic authority

This prevents the Canon from becoming a total system.

---

### V. Operational Application Boundaries

Defines how the Canon enters real systems without consuming them.

Covers:

- explicit application
- locality of application
- non-retroactivity
- boundaries and interfaces
- derivation without equivalence
- compliance theater avoidance

This layer enables safe coexistence with reality.

---

### VI. Conflict and Uncertainty Handling

Addresses situations where the Canon does not yield a single answer.

Clarifies:

- hierarchy-based conflict resolution
- prohibition of interpretive balancing
- irreducibility of uncertainty
- separation of validity from judgment

This layer protects human and institutional responsibility.

---

### VII. Derivative Separation

Defines how derivative artifacts may exist without redefining the Canon.

Includes:

- whitepapers
- specifications
- standards
- policies
- agent behaviors

Key rule:
Derivatives may reference the Canon.
They may not replace or redefine it.

---

### VIII. Meta-Stability and Evolution

Defines how the Canon changes without erosion.

Covers:

- versioning
- explicit change
- correction vs. revision
- stability declarations
- what must never enter the Canon

This layer preserves long-term integrity.

---

## What This Map Is Not

This map is not:

- a checklist
- a compliance guide
- a governance model
- a summary of rules
- an alternative Canon

It must not be cited as authority.

---

## Relationship to the Canon

If this map conflicts with any canonical document:

- the map is wrong
- the Canon prevails
- the map must be corrected or discarded

The Canon does not depend on this map.
This map depends entirely on the Canon.

---

## Status

This document may change freely.
Such changes do not affect canonical meaning.
