# Definitions

This document defines the **canonical meanings** of terms used throughout the System Momentum Canon.

Definitions are **binding**.  
Where a term is defined here, no alternative interpretation is permitted.

---

## Canon

**Canon**  
The authoritative set of invariant principles, constraints, and prohibitions that define validity within System Momentum.

The Canon:

- defines boundaries
- does not prescribe execution
- remains valid independent of adoption

---

## Invariant

**Invariant**  
A truth that remains valid regardless of domain, institution, implementation, or context.

Invariants:

- do not depend on tools or processes
- are not optimized
- are not negotiated

---

## Constraint

**Constraint**  
A rule that limits permissible structures or behaviors without prescribing a specific outcome.

Constraints:

- restrict possibility space
- prevent invalid patterns
- do not imply solutions

---

## Prohibited Pattern

**Prohibited Pattern**  
A structural arrangement explicitly disallowed by the Canon.

Prohibited patterns:

- are invalid regardless of effectiveness
- cannot be legitimized by success
- must be rejected at any level of the hierarchy

---

## Authority

**Canonical Authority**  
The capacity to define validity within the scope of the Canon.

Canonical authority:

- is structural, not social
- does not compel adoption
- is independent of power or enforcement

---

## Custodian

**Custodian**  
The designated party responsible for maintaining the Canon’s integrity.

A custodian:

- preserves invariants
- enforces constraints
- rejects invalid changes
- does not own the Canon

---

## Institutional Realization

**Institutional Realization**  
The projection of canonical truths into structures where judgment, responsibility, and correction occur.

Institutional realization:

- is not a domain extension
- does not generate invariants
- may fail without invalidating the Canon

---

## Domain Extension

**Domain Extension**  
A contextual instantiation of the Canon for a specific field of application.

Domain extensions:

- parameterize canonical truths
- do not alter invariants
- remain subordinate to the Core

---

## Implementation

**Implementation**  
A concrete realization of a domain extension through tools, processes, or systems.

Implementations:

- are replaceable
- are non-authoritative
- may diverge or fail without affecting canonical validity

---

## Derivative Artifact

**Derivative Artifact**  
Any document, system, institution, or product derived from the Canon.

Derivative artifacts:

- are non-canonical
- may claim alignment
- cannot redefine canonical meaning

---

## Validity

**Validity**  
Conformance to the Canon as defined by its invariants, constraints, and prohibitions.

Validity:

- is binary within scope
- does not depend on consensus
- is not retroactively granted

---

## Interpretation

**Interpretation**  
The act of applying canonical definitions to a specific context.

Interpretation:

- must respect hierarchy
- must not alter definitions
- does not create authority
