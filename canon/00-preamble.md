# Preamble

The System Momentum Canon exists to define **structural truth**.

It is not a proposal.
It is not a vision.
It is not an invitation.

It is a boundary.

---

## Why the Canon Exists

Complex systems fail primarily due to **structural invalidity**, not insufficient intelligence or effort.

When truth is allowed to emerge from:

- adoption
- consensus
- institutional authority
- technical success

systems lose the ability to distinguish correctness from momentum.

The Canon exists to prevent that failure mode.

---

## What the Canon Is

The Canon is a **normative, invariant reference**.

It:

- defines what is valid
- constrains what is permissible
- prohibits what must not occur

The Canon operates **above** domains, institutions, and implementations.

---

## What the Canon Is Not

The Canon is **not**:

- a technical specification
- a product blueprint
- a governance handbook
- an ethical manifesto
- a strategy document
- a substitute for judgment

Any attempt to use the Canon as a recipe constitutes misuse.

---

## Relationship to Reality

The Canon does not enforce compliance.

Reality may diverge.
Systems may ignore it.
Institutions may reject it.

The Canon remains valid regardless.

---

## Responsibility

The Canon assigns responsibility without coercion.

It clarifies where judgment must occur and where it must not.
It localizes accountability without distributing authority.

---

## Risk

Misapplication of the Canon is dangerous.

Using it to justify outcomes, authority, or power violates its purpose.
Using it to replace judgment collapses its function.

The Canon must be applied with restraint.

---

## Final Statement

The Canon stands on structure alone.

It does not persuade.
It does not adapt.
It does not apologize.

It defines validity.
