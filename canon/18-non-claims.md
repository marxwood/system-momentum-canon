# Non-Claims

This document defines what the System Momentum Canon **does not claim**.

The Canon constrains validity.
It does not assert facts about the world.

---

## No Factual Claims

The Canon makes **no factual claims**.

It does not assert:

- what exists
- what is true in the world
- what will occur
- what caused an outcome

Facts are external to the Canon.

---

## No Predictive Claims

The Canon makes **no predictions**.

It does not:

- forecast outcomes
- anticipate consequences
- predict behavior
- estimate risk

Prediction requires models and evidence.
The Canon provides neither.

---

## No Normative Claims Beyond Validity

The Canon makes **no normative claims** beyond structural validity.

It does not claim:

- what should be done
- what is preferable
- what is optimal
- what is acceptable in context

Normativity outside validity is external.

---

## No Epistemic Claims

The Canon does not determine knowledge.

It does not:

- define truth
- establish correctness
- arbitrate disagreement
- resolve uncertainty

Knowledge claims require epistemic processes outside the Canon.

---

## No Hidden or Implied Claims

The Canon contains **no hidden claims**.

Nothing may be inferred as a claim from:

- structure
- omission
- emphasis
- repetition
- silence

Claims exist only where explicitly stated.

---

## Misuse of Canon as Claim Source

The following are **invalid**:

- citing the Canon as evidence
- treating the Canon as proof
- asserting world-state from Canon content
- implying factual endorsement

The Canon is not a source of claims.

---

## Binding Effect

This document is binding.

Any attempt to extract claims from the Canon is invalid.
