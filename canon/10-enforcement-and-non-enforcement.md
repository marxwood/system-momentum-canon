# Enforcement and Non-Enforcement

This document defines the **non-enforcement nature** of the System Momentum Canon.

The Canon defines validity.
It does not enforce compliance.

---

## No Enforcement Mechanism

The Canon has **no enforcement mechanism**.

It does not:

- monitor behavior
- compel adherence
- apply sanctions
- police usage

Expecting enforcement is a category error.

---

## Authority Without Control

Canonical authority does not imply control.

Authority:

- defines validity
- does not mandate behavior
- does not intervene in execution

Control belongs to institutions and implementations, not the Canon.

---

## Non-Compliance

Non-compliance is permitted.

Actors may:

- ignore the Canon
- violate constraints
- reject alignment

Non-compliance does not weaken the Canon.
It clarifies divergence.

---

## No Protective Function

The Canon does not protect:

- users
- institutions
- outcomes
- values
- intentions

Protection requires enforcement.
The Canon provides none.

---

## Misuse of Enforcement Language

The following claims are **invalid**:

- “Canon enforcement”
- “Canon compliance program”
- “Canon audit”
- “Canon violation penalty”
- “Canon protection”

Such language implies authority the Canon does not possess.

---

## Responsibility Remains External

Responsibility for action, harm, or consequence lies entirely with actors and institutions.

The Canon:

- does not absorb responsibility
- does not distribute blame
- does not shield decision-makers

---

## Alignment Without Enforcement

Alignment is voluntary.

It has:

- no guarantees
- no rewards
- no penalties

Alignment defines a state, not a privilege.

---

## Binding Effect

This document is binding.

Any representation of the Canon as an enforcement system is invalid.
