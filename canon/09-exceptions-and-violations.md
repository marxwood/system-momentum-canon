# Exceptions and Violations

This document defines how **exceptions** and **violations** are treated within the System Momentum Canon.

The Canon does not operate on exceptions.
It operates on validity.

---

## No Canonical Exceptions

There are **no canonical exceptions**.

No context, urgency, locality, or pragmatism may suspend or bypass:

- invariants
- constraints
- non-negotiables
- hierarchical directionality

If an exception is required, the Canon is being violated.

---

## Temporary Exceptions Are Invalid

“Temporary” exceptions are invalid.

Time-bound deviation does not preserve validity.
Local deviation does not preserve validity.
Intent does not preserve validity.

Violation remains violation regardless of duration.

---

## Explicit Violation Acknowledgment

Violations may be **acknowledged**, but not legitimized.

Acknowledgment:

- does not restore validity
- does not suspend constraints
- does not create precedent

It only clarifies deviation.

---

## Violation vs. Change

Violations are not change.

- A violation ignores the Canon.
- A change modifies the Canon through explicit process.

Using violations as justification for change is prohibited.

---

## No Pragmatic Override

Pragmatism does not override validity.

Efficiency, necessity, or survival arguments do not suspend canonical constraints.

Outcomes do not retroactively justify violations.

---

## Handling Violations

When a violation occurs, only three options exist:

1. **Replace** the violating structure.
2. **Abandon** the violating initiative.
3. **Initiate explicit Canon change** (if justified).

There is no fourth option.

---

## Prohibition of Exception Normalization

Repeated violations do not normalize exceptions.

Normalization:

- does not create legitimacy
- does not alter meaning
- must be corrected or terminated

Practice does not evolve the Canon.

---

## Binding Effect

This document is binding.

Any attempt to introduce exceptions is invalid.
