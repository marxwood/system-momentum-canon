# Canonical Conflicts

This document defines how **apparent conflicts** within the System Momentum Canon are handled.

The Canon is hierarchical.
Conflicts are resolved structurally, not interpretively.

---

## No True Internal Contradictions

The Canon contains no true contradictions.

What appears as conflict is:

- misreading
- context collapse
- hierarchy violation
- selective citation

Assuming contradiction is a failure of application.

---

## Hierarchy Governs Resolution

Conflicts are resolved strictly by canonical hierarchy.

Rules:

- higher-level documents override lower-level documents
- axioms override constraints
- constraints override guidance
- non-negotiables override all downstream content

There is no balancing across levels.

---

## No Interpretive Balancing

Interpretive balancing is prohibited.

The following are **invalid**:

- weighing one canonical rule against another
- trading off constraints
- synthesizing “middle positions”
- resolving by preference or convenience

Balance is not resolution.

---

## No Contextual Overrides

Context does not override the Canon.

Context may:

- determine applicability
- determine relevance

Context must not:

- override hierarchy
- suspend constraints
- weaken non-negotiables

---

## Apparent Conflict Handling

When an apparent conflict arises:

1. Verify hierarchical order.
2. Identify governing constraints.
3. Discard downstream contradictions.
4. Accept residual uncertainty.

If uncertainty remains, it is external to the Canon.

---

## Conflict vs. Incompleteness

Conflict must not be confused with incompleteness.

- Conflict implies contradiction.
- Incompleteness implies silence.

The Canon permits incompleteness.
It does not permit contradiction.

---

## Misuse of Conflict Claims

The following are **invalid**:

- declaring Canon inconsistency
- using conflict to justify exception
- invoking ambiguity to bypass constraints
- demanding interpretive resolution

Conflict claims must be structural.

---

## Binding Effect

This document is binding.

Any attempt to resolve canonical conflict through interpretation or balancing is invalid.
