# Canonical Index

This document provides a **structural index** of the System Momentum Canon.

It does not introduce new meaning.
It maps existing canonical structure.

---

## Canonical Reading Order

The Canon must be read in the following order:

- `canon/00-preamble.md`
- `canon/01-canonical-hierarchy.md`
- `canon/02-scope-and-non-goals.md`
- `canon/03-definitions.md`
- `canon/04-axioms.md`
- `canon/05-constraints.md`
- `canon/06-non-negotiables.md`

No downstream document may be read without understanding the above.

---

## Misuse and Protection Layer

The following documents protect the Canon from misuse and misinterpretation:

- `canon/07-alignment-and-misuse.md`
- `canon/08-interpretation-boundaries.md`
- `canon/09-exceptions-and-violations.md`
- `canon/10-enforcement-and-non-enforcement.md`
- `canon/11-responsibility-and-attribution.md`
- `canon/12-canon-is-not-decision.md`
- `canon/13-canon-is-not-intelligence.md`
- `canon/14-canon-and-agents.md`
- `canon/15-canon-and-moral-absolutism.md`

These documents do not extend the Canon.
They constrain its misuse.

---

## Governance Layer

Canonical governance is defined in:

- `governance/authority.md`
- `governance/change-policy.md`
- `governance/institutional-capture.md`

Governance applies only after canonical structure is understood.

---

## Status and Versions

Canonical state and versioning are defined in:

- `STATUS.md`
- `versions/`

Snapshots are read-only references.

---

## Interpretation Rules

- The Canon is read top-down.
- No document overrides a higher-level document.
- Later documents cannot redefine earlier ones.
- Absence of mention does not imply permission.

---

## Index Scope

This index:

- maps structure
- does not add authority
- does not interpret content

Any conflict must be resolved by canonical hierarchy, not by this index.
