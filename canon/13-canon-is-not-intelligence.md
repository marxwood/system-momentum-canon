# Canon Is Not Intelligence

This document defines the relationship between the System Momentum Canon and intelligence.

The Canon constrains validity.
It does not think.

---

## No Cognitive Function

The Canon has **no cognitive function**.

It does not:

- understand
- reason
- learn
- infer intent
- resolve ambiguity

Treating the Canon as a thinking system is invalid.

---

## Intelligence Is External

All intelligence remains external to the Canon.

Understanding, reasoning, and judgment:

- occur in minds and systems
- require context and interpretation
- cannot be embedded in constraints alone

The Canon does not produce intelligence.
It limits invalid structures.

---

## Compliance Is Not Understanding

Compliance with the Canon does not imply understanding.

An actor may:

- follow constraints
- respect non-negotiables
- remain entirely non-intelligent

Understanding requires active cognition.
The Canon does not supply it.

---

## Invalid Intelligence Substitution

The following uses are **invalid**:

- treating the Canon as a reasoning framework
- using the Canon to replace analysis
- assuming intelligence emerges from constraint adherence
- equating alignment with comprehension

Constraints do not think.

---

## Canon and Learning Systems

Learning systems may reference the Canon.

They must not:

- internalize the Canon as cognition
- treat constraints as intelligence
- substitute Canon compliance for reasoning

Learning occurs outside the Canon.

---

## Misuse as Epistemic Authority

The Canon is not an epistemic authority.

It does not determine:

- what is true in the world
- what is correct in context
- what should be believed

It only determines structural validity.

---

## Binding Effect

This document is binding.

Any use of the Canon as intelligence or cognition is invalid.
