# Canonical Silence

This document defines the meaning of **silence** within the System Momentum Canon.

Silence is not a claim.
It is not a position.
It is not permission.

---

## Silence Is Non-Assertion

Where the Canon is silent, it asserts nothing.

Silence:

- does not imply approval
- does not imply rejection
- does not imply relevance
- does not imply irrelevance

No meaning may be inferred from absence.

---

## No Implied Permissions

Canonical silence does not grant permission.

Permission exists only where explicitly defined.
Absence of prohibition is not authorization.

---

## No Implied Prohibitions

Canonical silence does not prohibit.

Prohibition exists only where explicitly stated through:

- constraints
- non-negotiables
- prohibited patterns

Silence must not be weaponized.

---

## No Negative Claims

The Canon does not make negative claims by omission.

The following are invalid:

- “The Canon does not mention X, therefore X is invalid”
- “The Canon is silent on Y, therefore Y must not exist”
- “If it mattered, the Canon would say so”

Absence is not negation.

---

## Contextual Judgment Required

Where the Canon is silent:

- judgment is required
- context governs
- responsibility remains external

Silence shifts responsibility outward.
It does not resolve uncertainty.

---

## Misuse of Silence

The following are **invalid** uses of canonical silence:

- inferring intent
- enforcing absence
- claiming hidden meaning
- asserting implied coverage

Silence cannot be interpreted.

---

## Binding Effect

This document is binding.

Any inference drawn from canonical silence is invalid.
