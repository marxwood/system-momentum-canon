# Boundaries and Interfaces

This document defines the **boundaries** of the System Momentum Canon and the **interfaces** through which it may be related to external artifacts.

The Canon defines limits.
It does not occupy interior space.

---

## Canonical Boundaries

The Canon establishes boundaries of validity.

It does not:

- describe internal operation of systems
- define internal processes
- specify internal roles
- prescribe internal behaviors

Everything beyond canonical boundaries is external.

---

## Interface Concept

An **interface** is the explicit point at which the Canon is related to a non-canonical artifact.

Interfaces:

- are declared
- are contextual
- do not transfer authority
- do not import external meaning into the Canon

There is no implicit interface.

---

## One-Way Constraint Flow

Constraint flow across the interface is **one-way**.

- Canon → external artifacts: constraints apply
- External artifacts → Canon: no influence

No external structure may project meaning back into the Canon.

---

## No Boundary Expansion

Interfaces must not expand canonical boundaries.

Using the Canon to:

- justify internal design choices
- dictate internal architecture
- mandate internal procedures

constitutes boundary violation.

---

## No Interface Aggregation

Interfaces do not aggregate.

Multiple interfaces:

- do not compose into a new canonical layer
- do not form an intermediary authority
- do not create a “canonical system”

Aggregation implies structure the Canon does not define.

---

## Interface Failure

Failure at the interface:

- does not invalidate the Canon
- does not require canonical correction
- remains external responsibility

The Canon does not absorb interface failure.

---

## Misuse of Interfaces

The following are **invalid**:

- implicit interfaces
- boundary-blurring interpretations
- importing external semantics
- exporting canonical authority

Interfaces must remain thin and explicit.

---

## Binding Effect

This document is binding.

Any violation of canonical boundaries or interface rules is invalid.
