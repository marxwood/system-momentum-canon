# Constraints

This document defines the **canonical constraints** of the System Momentum Canon.

Constraints operationalize axioms by **limiting permissible structures**.  
They do not prescribe solutions.  
They bound what is allowed.

---

## Constraint 1 — No Upward Truth Projection

No implementation, domain extension, or institution may redefine canonical truth.

Any attempt to project truth upward constitutes a canonical violation.

---

## Constraint 2 — No Implicit Authority

Authority must be explicit.

Implicit authority derived from expertise, seniority, popularity, or success is invalid.

---

## Constraint 3 — No Structural Coupling to Implementation

Canonical validity must not depend on specific tools, platforms, vendors, or stacks.

Any structural coupling constitutes a violation.

---

## Constraint 4 — No Post Hoc Justification

Canonical alignment cannot be claimed after the fact.

Structures must be valid by design, not by outcome.

---

## Constraint 5 — No Optimization Without Constraint

Optimization efforts that precede constraint definition are invalid.

Efficiency gains that amplify invalid structures are prohibited.

---

## Constraint 6 — No Collective Redefinition

Canonical meaning must not be redefined through consensus, voting, or aggregation.

Collective processes may operate only within defined canonical boundaries.

---

## Constraint 7 — No Silent Evolution

Canonical truth does not evolve through usage, habit, or time.

All changes require explicit declaration and acceptance.

---

## Constraint 8 — No Responsibility Diffusion

Judgment and accountability must have a defined location.

Structures that diffuse responsibility without localization are invalid.

---

## Constraint 9 — No Canonical Exception by Success

No level of success, adoption, or impact can create exceptions to the Canon.

Exceptions must be explicit or do not exist.

---

## Constraint 10 — No Canon Without Boundaries

Any system claiming alignment without accepting constraints is invalid.

Partial adoption does not confer partial validity.
