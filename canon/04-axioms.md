# Axioms

This document defines the **axioms** of the System Momentum Canon.

Axioms are foundational truths.  
They are not derived, optimized, or justified.  
If an axiom is false, the Canon does not hold.

---

## Axiom 1 — Separation of Truth and Execution

Truth is independent of execution.

No implementation, institution, or process can define or modify canonical truth.  
Execution may succeed or fail without affecting validity.

---

## Axiom 2 — Structural Over Behavioral Priority

Structure precedes behavior.

Systems fail structurally before they fail behaviorally.  
Canonical correctness is determined by structure, not outcomes.

---

## Axiom 3 — Non-Equivalence of Adoption and Validity

Adoption does not imply validity.

Widespread use, consensus, or success cannot legitimize a canonical violation.  
Validity is determined solely by conformance to the Canon.

---

## Axiom 4 — Directionality of Projection

Canonical truth projects downward.

Truth flows from Core to institutions, domains, and implementations.  
No lower-level artifact may project truth upward.

---

## Axiom 5 — Replaceability of Implementations

All implementations are replaceable.

No implementation is essential to the Canon.  
Dependence on a specific implementation constitutes structural failure.

---

## Axiom 6 — Explicitness Over Implicit Evolution

Change must be explicit.

There is no implicit evolution of canonical truth.  
Silence, drift, or practice do not alter the Canon.

---

## Axiom 7 — Responsibility Requires Location

Judgment requires a defined location.

Where responsibility is diffused, correction collapses.  
Institutional realization exists to localize judgment without altering truth.

---

## Axiom 8 — Constraint Over Optimization

Constraints precede optimization.

Optimization without constraints amplifies invalid structures.  
Canonical constraints exist to bound possibility before improvement.

---

## Axiom 9 — Authority Without Enforcement

Canonical authority exists without enforcement.

The Canon does not compel behavior.  
It defines validity regardless of compliance.

---

## Axiom 10 — Irreversibility of Violation

Canonical violations are irreversible.

Success cannot retroactively legitimize an invalid structure.  
Correction requires replacement, not justification.
