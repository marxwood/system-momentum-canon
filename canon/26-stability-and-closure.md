# Stability and Closure

This document defines the **stability conditions** and **closure** of the System Momentum Canon.

The Canon is finite.
Its stability is intentional.

---

## Canonical Closure

The Core Canon is closed.

Closure means:

- no implicit extensions
- no gradual accretion
- no scope creep
- no silent evolution

Any addition requires explicit change procedure.

---

## Stability as a Property

Stability is a primary property of the Canon.

Stability ensures:

- resistance to reinterpretation
- immunity to drift
- protection from gradual capture
- long-term reliability

Instability invalidates trust.

---

## No Incremental Expansion

The Canon must not expand incrementally.

The following are **invalid**:

- adding rules “as needed”
- patching perceived gaps
- extending coverage opportunistically
- responding to edge cases with new constraints

Expansion without formal revision is prohibited.

---

## Revision vs. Extension

Revisions:

- correct errors
- clarify ambiguity
- restore intended meaning

Extensions:

- add new domains
- expand scope
- introduce new authority

Only revisions are permitted within the Core Canon.
Extensions require a new canonical layer.

---

## Separation of Core and Derivatives

The Core Canon must remain separate from:

- experiments
- interpretations
- implementations
- domain-specific adaptations

These belong to derivative layers.

---

## Canonical Finality

Finality does not imply perfection.

It implies:

- bounded responsibility
- explicit limits
- acceptance of incompleteness

The Canon ends by design.

---

## Binding Effect

This document is binding.

Any attempt to evolve the Core Canon outside formal revision is invalid.
