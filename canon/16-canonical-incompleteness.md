# Canonical Incompleteness

This document defines the **intentional incompleteness** of the System Momentum Canon.

The Canon defines boundaries of validity.
It does not enumerate reality.

---

## Incompleteness Is Intentional

The Canon is intentionally incomplete.

It does not:

- describe all valid structures
- enumerate all invalid structures
- cover all domains
- anticipate all scenarios

Completeness would imply authority the Canon does not claim.

---

## Absence Is Not Prohibition

What is not mentioned in the Canon is **not automatically prohibited**.

Prohibition exists only where explicitly defined through:

- invariants
- constraints
- non-negotiables
- prohibited patterns

Silence does not imply invalidity.

---

## No Exhaustive Coverage

The Canon does not aim for exhaustive coverage.

Attempts to:

- “complete” the Canon
- fill every gap
- preempt every edge case

are invalid.

Such efforts collapse the Canon into a rulebook.

---

## Context Remains External

Contextual understanding remains external to the Canon.

Determining:

- relevance
- applicability
- consequence

requires judgment beyond canonical scope.

The Canon does not replace contextual reasoning.

---

## Misuse of Incompleteness

The following are **invalid**:

- treating Canon silence as denial
- claiming non-existence of non-canonical truths
- enforcing Canon coverage as total
- equating absence with error

The Canon bounds validity, not existence.

---

## Canon vs. Total Systems

The Canon must not become a total system.

Total systems:

- eliminate uncertainty
- suppress judgment
- centralize authority

The Canon exists to prevent such collapse.

---

## Binding Effect

This document is binding.

Any treatment of the Canon as complete or exhaustive is invalid.
