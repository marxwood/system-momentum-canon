# Canon Is Not Decision

This document defines the relationship between the System Momentum Canon and decision-making.

The Canon constrains validity.
It does not decide.

---

## No Decision Function

The Canon has **no decision function**.

It does not:

- select options
- rank alternatives
- recommend actions
- optimize outcomes
- resolve trade-offs

Any use of the Canon as a decision mechanism is invalid.

---

## Decision Responsibility

All decisions remain external to the Canon.

Actors and institutions must:

- evaluate options
- accept uncertainty
- choose actions
- bear consequences

The Canon does not reduce decision burden.
It bounds what is valid.

---

## Invalid Decision Substitution

The following are **invalid** uses of the Canon:

- “The Canon implies we should choose X”
- “This is the most Canon-aligned decision”
- “The Canon leaves no alternative”
- “Canon compliance determines the optimal choice”

The Canon never eliminates choice.

---

## Constraints Are Not Preferences

Constraints limit possibility.
They do not express preference.

Within valid boundaries:

- multiple decisions may exist
- no decision is canonically superior

Choosing among them is non-canonical work.

---

## Uncertainty Is Not Resolved

The Canon does not resolve uncertainty.

Uncertainty:

- remains
- must be confronted
- cannot be delegated

Using the Canon to escape uncertainty is misuse.

---

## Decision Failure vs. Canon Violation

Bad decisions are not Canon violations.

Violations concern structure.
Decisions concern judgment.

Conflating the two is invalid.

---

## Binding Effect

This document is binding.

Any substitution of decision-making with the Canon is invalid.
