# Responsibility and Attribution

This document defines how **responsibility and attribution** operate in relation to the System Momentum Canon.

The Canon constrains validity.
It does not make decisions.

---

## No Decision Delegation

Decisions cannot be delegated to the Canon.

The Canon:

- does not decide
- does not choose
- does not authorize action

Any claim that an action was taken “because of the Canon” is invalid.

---

## Responsibility Remains With Actors

All responsibility remains with actors and institutions.

Actors are responsible for:

- interpreting the Canon
- deciding whether to align
- choosing actions
- accepting consequences

The Canon absorbs no responsibility.

---

## Invalid Attribution Claims

The following attributions are **invalid**:

- “The Canon required this decision”
- “We had no choice under the Canon”
- “The Canon dictated the outcome”
- “This was the only Canon-aligned option”

The Canon never eliminates choice.

---

## Canon vs. Justification

The Canon cannot be used as justification.

Justification:

- explains reasons
- defends decisions
- assigns legitimacy

The Canon does none of these.

It only defines validity boundaries.

---

## No Moral or Legal Shield

The Canon provides no moral or legal protection.

Alignment does not:

- excuse harm
- mitigate liability
- reduce accountability
- transfer blame

Responsibility cannot be externalized.

---

## Attribution Integrity

Attribution must be explicit and honest.

Valid attribution takes the form:

- “We chose to act within Canon constraints”
- “We accepted the trade-offs imposed by the Canon”
- “We knowingly violated the Canon”

Anything else constitutes misrepresentation.

---

## Structural Accountability

Where decisions are made:

- responsibility must be visible
- attribution must be local
- accountability must be explicit

Structures that obscure responsibility are invalid.

---

## Binding Effect

This document is binding.

Any attempt to transfer responsibility to the Canon is invalid.
