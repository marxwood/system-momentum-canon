# Canonical Hierarchy

This document defines the **canonical hierarchy** of System Momentum.

The hierarchy is **normative**.  
It establishes how truths, responsibilities, and implementations are separated and related.

No part of the Canon may be interpreted outside this structure.

## Normative Rules

1. **Core (Invariant Layer)**  
   The Core defines truths that are independent of domain, institution, or implementation.  
   Core elements **MUST NOT** depend on implementation details, organizational structures, or tooling.

2. **Institutional Realization**  
   Institutional Realization is **not** a domain extension.  
   It defines where judgment occurs, how responsibility is assigned, and how errors are corrected without systemic collapse.

3. **Projection Direction**  
   Truth flows **downward** through the hierarchy.  
   Authority flows **upward** through explicit accountability.

4. **Domain Extensions**  
   Domain Extensions **MAY NOT** introduce new invariants.  
   They instantiate or parameterize Core truths for a specific domain without altering them.

5. **Implementations**  
   Implementations are replaceable, plural, and non-authoritative.  
   No implementation may claim canonical status.

6. **Violation Handling**  
   Any implementation or extension that contradicts the Core is **invalid**, regardless of adoption or success.

7. **Change Scope**  
   Changes at lower levels **MUST NOT** force changes at higher levels.  
   Changes at higher levels invalidate incompatible lower-level artifacts.

8. **Interpretation Constraint**  
   No rule may be interpreted in isolation from its hierarchical context.

## Binding Effect

This hierarchy is binding for:

- all Canon documents
- all institutional projections
- all domain extensions
- all implementations claiming alignment

Deviation requires explicit Canon change.
Implicit reinterpretation is prohibited.
