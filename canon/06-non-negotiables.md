# Non-Negotiables

This document defines the **non-negotiable elements** of the System Momentum Canon.

Non-negotiables are absolute.  
They do not change across versions, contexts, institutions, or implementations.

Violation invalidates alignment.

---

## Non-Negotiable 1 — Canon Precedes Implementation

The Canon exists prior to and independent of any implementation.

No implementation may:

- define the Canon
- alter canonical meaning
- substitute for canonical authority

---

## Non-Negotiable 2 — Authority Is Singular and Explicit

Canonical authority must be singular and explicit.

Distributed, implicit, or emergent authority is invalid.

---

## Non-Negotiable 3 — Invariants Are Untouchable

Invariants cannot be optimized, negotiated, or contextualized away.

Any attempt to weaken or relativize invariants is invalid.

---

## Non-Negotiable 4 — Constraints Are Binding

Constraints are mandatory.

They are not guidelines, best practices, or recommendations.
They are conditions of validity.

---

## Non-Negotiable 5 — Prohibited Patterns Remain Prohibited

Prohibited patterns do not become acceptable through:

- success
- efficiency
- consensus
- moral alignment
- institutional backing

Invalid remains invalid.

---

## Non-Negotiable 6 — No Retroactive Legitimization

Canonical violations cannot be legitimized retroactively.

Correction requires replacement, not justification.

---

## Non-Negotiable 7 — No Silent Redefinition

Canonical meaning cannot change implicitly.

All change must be:

- explicit
- intentional
- declared

Undeclared change is invalid.

---

## Non-Negotiable 8 — Derivatives Are Subordinate

All derivative artifacts are subordinate to the Canon.

No derivative may:

- redefine canonical terms
- override constraints
- claim canonical status

---

## Non-Negotiable 9 — Forking Preserves Canonical Integrity

Forking is permitted and non-destructive.

Forks are:

- non-canonical
- independent
- explicitly divergent

Forking does not weaken the Canon.

---

## Non-Negotiable 10 — Validity Is Binary

Within scope, validity is binary.

Partial validity does not exist.
Alignment is either valid or invalid.
