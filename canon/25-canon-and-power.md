# Canon and Power

This document defines the relationship between the System Momentum Canon and power.

The Canon constrains power.
It must not become power.

---

## No Power Source

The Canon is not a source of power.

It does not:

- grant authority
- legitimize control
- justify enforcement
- confer mandate

Any attempt to derive power from the Canon is invalid.

---

## Power Capture Patterns

The following patterns constitute **power capture** and are invalid:

- authority laundering (“the Canon requires…”)
- policy laundering (“Canon-aligned policy” used to compel behavior)
- compliance theater used to enforce conformity
- validator outputs presented as mandates
- citation used to silence opposition

These patterns must be actively resisted.

---

## Institutional Misuse

Institutions must not use the Canon to:

- expand jurisdiction
- centralize decision-making
- suppress dissent
- enforce conformity
- shield accountability

Institutional alignment does not imply legitimacy.

---

## Micro-Power Mechanisms

Power capture often occurs through micro-mechanisms, including:

- meeting rituals framed as alignment
- documentation requirements presented as necessity
- procedural delays justified by “canonical review”
- informal pressure via implied non-alignment

These mechanisms are invalid regardless of intent.

---

## No Enforcement Delegation

The Canon delegates no enforcement power.

Enforcement:

- remains external
- must be justified independently
- cannot cite the Canon as mandate

“Enforced due to Canon” is invalid.

---

## Resistance to Power Accretion

Any structure that accumulates power through Canon reference is suspect.

Signs include:

- exclusive interpretive roles
- centralized validators
- mandatory alignment declarations
- escalation paths tied to Canon citation

Such structures violate canonical intent.

---

## Canon as Constraint, Not Lever

The Canon functions only as a constraint on structure.

It must not be:

- a lever
- a weapon
- a badge
- a gate

Constraint without leverage is the design goal.

---

## Binding Effect

This document is binding.

Any use of the Canon to acquire, justify, or exercise power is invalid.
