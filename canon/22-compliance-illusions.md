# Compliance Illusions

This document defines common **compliance illusions** related to the System Momentum Canon.

Compliance with the Canon cannot be simulated.

---

## No Checklist Compliance

The Canon is not checklist-compliant.

There is:

- no list of required actions
- no finite set of steps
- no completion state

Checklist completion does not imply validity.

---

## No Certification or Badging

The Canon does not support:

- certification
- accreditation
- badging
- scoring
- maturity levels

Any claim of certified Canon compliance is invalid.

Verification services may exist, but they must not claim canonical certification.
They may report test results and evidence only, scoped to what is explicitly checkable.

---

## No Audit Theater

Audits cannot establish canonical validity.

Audit artifacts:

- do not prove alignment
- do not transfer authority
- do not substitute understanding

Validity is structural, not procedural.

---

## Ritualized Alignment

Ritualized behaviors such as:

- compliance meetings
- alignment reviews
- canonical check-ins

do not establish validity.

Ritual is not structure.

---

## Metric Substitution

Metrics are not proxies for canonical validity.

The following are **invalid**:

- alignment scores
- compliance percentages
- Canon KPIs
- optimization targets

Validity is not measurable.

---

## Cosmetic Compliance

Surface-level signals such as:

- terminology adoption
- document references
- symbolic gestures

do not imply validity.

Appearance is not structure.

---

## Binding Effect

This document is binding.

Any attempt to simulate or perform compliance with the Canon is invalid.
