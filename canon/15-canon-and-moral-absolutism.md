# Canon and Moral Absolutism

This document defines the relationship between the System Momentum Canon and morality.

The Canon defines validity.
It does not define what is good.

---

## No Moral Authority

The Canon has **no moral authority**.

It does not:

- define good or evil
- assign virtue or vice
- determine justice
- legitimize harm

Treating the Canon as a moral law is invalid.

---

## Validity Is Not Goodness

Canonical validity is not moral goodness.

A structure may be:

- canonically valid and morally wrong
- canonically invalid and morally motivated

The Canon does not arbitrate morality.

---

## No Moral Absolutism

The Canon must not become an absolute moral reference.

It must not be used to:

- silence ethical debate
- claim moral superiority
- declare moral finality
- replace moral reasoning

Absolutism collapses judgment.

---

## Canon and Ethics

Ethical systems may reference the Canon.

They must not:

- derive moral truth from it
- treat it as ethical ground
- collapse ethics into structure

Ethics remains external.

---

## Invalid Moral Claims

The following claims are **invalid**:

- “This is morally right because it aligns with the Canon”
- “The Canon proves this is just”
- “Canon alignment guarantees ethical correctness”

No such guarantee exists.

---

## Moral Responsibility Remains Human

Moral responsibility remains with humans and institutions.

The Canon:

- does not absolve guilt
- does not confer virtue
- does not justify harm

Responsibility cannot be externalized.

---

## Binding Effect

This document is binding.

Any use of the Canon as a moral absolute is invalid.
