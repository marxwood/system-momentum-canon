# Scope and Non-Goals

This document defines the **explicit scope** of the System Momentum Canon and, more importantly, its **non-goals**.

The purpose is to prevent misinterpretation, overreach, and premature instrumentalization.

---

## In Scope

The Canon is concerned with:

- defining invariant principles
- establishing non-negotiable constraints
- prohibiting invalid structural patterns
- separating truth from its institutional and technical projections
- constraining how systems, agents, and institutions may operate

The Canon operates at the level of **structural truth**, not execution.

---

## Out of Scope (Non-Goals)

The Canon explicitly does **not** aim to:

- prescribe specific implementations
- define technical architectures or stacks
- provide operational procedures or playbooks
- function as a governance manual for organizations
- serve as a political, ethical, or ideological manifesto
- optimize for efficiency, adoption, or market fit
- justify decisions post hoc

The Canon does not seek consensus.
It establishes boundaries.

---

## Forbidden Interpretations

The Canon **MUST NOT** be interpreted as:

- a product roadmap
- a framework to be adopted wholesale
- a certification standard
- an appeal to authority
- a substitute for judgment

Any attempt to stretch the Canon beyond its defined scope constitutes misuse.

---

## Relationship to Derivative Artifacts

Whitepapers, specifications, institutions, and implementations **may** be derived from the Canon.

Such artifacts:

- are non-canonical
- are replaceable
- may fail without invalidating the Canon

The Canon remains valid regardless of derivative success or failure.

---

## Binding Effect

Scope limitations are binding.

Claims of alignment that violate these boundaries are invalid.
