# Alignment and Misuse

This document defines what **alignment with the Canon means**, and how claims of alignment may be misused.

Alignment is a **binding condition**, not a declaration.

---

## Alignment Defined

**Alignment** means full conformance to the Canon, including:

- all invariants
- all constraints
- all non-negotiables
- the canonical hierarchy
- the authority and change policy

Alignment is **holistic**.
Partial alignment does not exist.

---

## Invalid Alignment Claims

The following claims are **invalid**:

- alignment with selected parts of the Canon
- alignment “in principle” or “in spirit”
- alignment subject to local interpretation
- alignment contingent on context or phase
- alignment claimed after implementation

Any such claim constitutes misrepresentation.

---

## Alignment Preconditions

An entity may claim alignment **only if**:

- the Canon has been read in full
- all constraints are accepted without exception
- prohibited patterns are actively rejected
- authority and change rules are respected

Acceptance must precede execution.

---

## Alignment Is Not Certification

The Canon does not certify.

There is:

- no approval process
- no endorsement
- no compliance badge

Claims of certification or official approval are invalid.

---

## Alignment and Authority

Alignment does not confer authority.

Aligned entities:

- do not speak for the Canon
- do not enforce the Canon
- do not interpret the Canon on behalf of others

Authority remains singular and canonical.

---

## Misuse

The following constitute **canonical misuse**:

- using alignment claims to justify power
- using the Canon to legitimize outcomes
- using the Canon as a branding device
- invoking alignment to suppress dissent
- substituting alignment for judgment

Misuse does not weaken the Canon.
It invalidates the claim.

---

## Consequence of Misuse

Misuse results in **loss of alignment validity**.

No warning or remediation is implied.
Validity is binary.

---

## Binding Effect

This document is binding.

Any claim of alignment must satisfy its conditions.
