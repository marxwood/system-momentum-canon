# Scope of Application

This document defines the **scope of application** of the System Momentum Canon.

The Canon constrains validity **only where it is explicitly applied**.

---

## Explicit Application Only

The Canon applies **only when explicitly invoked**.

It does not apply:

- by default
- by association
- by proximity
- by reference alone

Application must be intentional and declared.

---

## No Universal Applicability

The Canon is not universally applicable.

It does not automatically govern:

- all systems
- all institutions
- all decisions
- all agents

Applicability is contextual and chosen.

---

## Localized Application

Where applied, the Canon applies **locally**.

Application:

- does not propagate automatically
- does not bind adjacent systems
- does not extend through dependency alone

Each application context is independent.

---

## No Retroactive Application

The Canon must not be applied retroactively.

Past actions, structures, or decisions:

- are not reclassified by later Canon reference
- are not invalidated post hoc
- are not judged through backward application

Retroactive application is invalid.

---

## Application vs. Alignment

Application and alignment are distinct.

- Application declares relevance.
- Alignment declares conformance.

One does not imply the other.

---

## Misuse of Application Claims

The following are **invalid**:

- claiming Canon application without declaration
- asserting implied applicability
- expanding application through interpretation
- enforcing Canon where it was not adopted

Application must be explicit.

---

## Binding Effect

This document is binding.

Any claim of Canon applicability must satisfy these conditions.
