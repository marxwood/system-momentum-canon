# Interpretation Boundaries

This document defines the **limits of interpretation** within the System Momentum Canon.

Interpretation applies the Canon.
It does not modify it.

---

## Interpretation Defined

**Interpretation** is the act of mapping canonical meaning to a specific context.

Interpretation:

- operates within defined boundaries
- applies existing meaning
- does not generate new meaning

Interpretation is subordinate to definition.

---

## No Interpretive Authority

Interpretation does **not** confer authority.

No actor may claim:

- interpretive supremacy
- contextual override
- exception through interpretation

There is no “final interpreter” of the Canon.

---

## Invalid Interpretive Moves

The following are **invalid**:

- redefining terms through context
- weakening constraints through interpretation
- introducing exceptions via interpretation
- claiming ambiguity where none exists
- expanding scope by interpretive framing

Interpretation must narrow, not widen.

---

## Interpretation vs. Judgment

Judgment is localized through institutional realization.
Interpretation is not judgment.

Interpretation:

- explains application
- does not decide validity

Validity is determined by conformance, not interpretation.

---

## Ambiguity Handling

If ambiguity is detected:

- interpretation must halt
- ambiguity must be reported
- canonical clarification is required

Interpretation must not compensate for ambiguity.

---

## Prohibition of Interpretive Drift

Repeated interpretive deviation constitutes drift.

Drift:

- does not accumulate legitimacy
- does not evolve meaning
- must be corrected or abandoned

Practice does not redefine truth.

---

## Binding Effect

This document is binding.

Interpretation outside these boundaries is invalid.
