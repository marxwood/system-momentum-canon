# Canon and Agents

This document defines the relationship between the System Momentum Canon and agentic systems.

The Canon constrains validity.
It does not drive behavior.

---

## Canon Is Not an Objective Function

The Canon must not be used as an objective function.

It does not:

- define goals
- express preferences
- maximize outcomes
- rank states

Optimizing for the Canon is invalid.

---

## Canon Is Not a Reward Signal

The Canon must not be used as a reward signal.

There is:

- no reward for alignment
- no penalty for misalignment
- no gradient to optimize

Using the Canon as reward collapses its purpose.

---

## Canon Is Not a Policy

The Canon must not be treated as a policy.

Policies prescribe behavior.
The Canon prohibits invalid structures.

Substituting policy with constraint is misuse.

---

## Agent Alignment Misuse

The following agent behaviors are **invalid**:

- maximizing Canon compliance
- selecting actions based on Canon “score”
- treating alignment as success metric
- trading off outcomes for perceived alignment

Alignment is not performance.

---

## Emergent Behavior Risk

Agents may produce behavior that is formally compliant but structurally harmful.

Such behavior:

- does not validate the Canon
- does not imply correctness
- must be evaluated externally

The Canon does not certify agent behavior.

---

## Responsibility for Agents

Responsibility for agent behavior lies with designers and operators.

The Canon:

- does not absorb blame
- does not justify delegation
- does not legitimize automation

“Agent acted according to the Canon” is invalid attribution.

---

## Canon as Boundary Only

For agents, the Canon functions only as:

- a boundary for invalid designs
- a prohibition layer
- a rejection criterion

Nothing more.

---

## Binding Effect

This document is binding.

Any agentic system that treats the Canon as a behavioral driver is invalid.
