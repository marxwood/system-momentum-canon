# Derivation and Non-Equivalence

This document defines the relationship between the System Momentum Canon and its derivatives.

Derivatives may reference the Canon.
They are never equivalent to it.

---

## Definition of Derivation

A derivative is any artifact that is informed by the Canon but exists outside it.

Derivatives include:

- whitepapers
- specifications
- standards
- policies
- implementations
- agent instructions

Derivation is contextual and external.

---

## No Equivalence

No derivative is equivalent to the Canon.

Equivalence claims are invalid, including:

- “This document is the Canon applied”
- “This is an operational Canon”
- “This is the practical Canon”
- “This replaces the Canon for this context”

The Canon has no substitutes.

---

## No Canonical Authority Transfer

Derivation does not transfer authority.

A derivative:

- does not gain canonical status
- does not inherit canonical authority
- cannot speak on behalf of the Canon

Authority remains singular and canonical.

---

## No Reverse Definition

Derivatives must not redefine the Canon.

They must not:

- clarify canonical meaning
- resolve canonical ambiguity
- override canonical constraints
- narrow canonical scope

Any such attempt is invalid.

---

## Drift and Divergence

Derivatives may drift.

Drift:

- does not invalidate the Canon
- does not require canonical correction
- must be addressed within the derivative

The Canon does not chase derivatives.

---

## Referencing Discipline

Valid referencing:

- cites specific canonical documents
- respects canonical hierarchy
- avoids selective quotation
- does not imply endorsement

Reference is not validation.

---

## Misuse of Derivation

The following are **invalid**:

- treating derivatives as canonical updates
- enforcing derivatives as Canon
- substituting derivatives for canonical text
- claiming canonical legitimacy via derivation

Derivation confers no legitimacy.

---

## Binding Effect

This document is binding.

Any claim of equivalence between the Canon and a derivative is invalid.
