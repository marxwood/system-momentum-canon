# Citation and Quoting Rules

This document defines strict rules for **citation and quotation** of the System Momentum Canon.

Citation is not authorization.
Quotation is not legitimacy.

---

## Explicit Source Requirement

All citations must reference:

- the exact canonical file
- the exact section or paragraph
- the canonical version or commit hash

Generic references to “the Canon” are invalid.

---

## Hierarchical Context Requirement

Citations must respect canonical hierarchy.

Lower-level documents:

- cannot be cited without higher-level context
- must not be isolated from governing constraints

Cherry-picking is invalid.

---

## No Selective Quotation

Selective quotation is prohibited.

The following are **invalid**:

- quoting fragments out of context
- omitting governing constraints
- extracting statements to support conclusions

Quotation must preserve meaning, not convenience.

---

## No Legitimation by Citation

Citation does not confer legitimacy.

The following claims are **invalid**:

- “This is valid because the Canon says…”
- “The Canon authorizes…”
- “Canon citation proves correctness”

The Canon does not legitimize outcomes.

---

## No Substitution of Judgment

Citation must not replace judgment.

Referencing the Canon:

- does not resolve disputes
- does not end debate
- does not eliminate responsibility

Judgment remains external.

---

## Validator Output Quotation

Outputs from verification or validation services:

- may be cited as evidence
- must include scope and limitations
- must not be presented as Canon approval

PASS results are not endorsements.

---

## Public Communication Rules

In public communication:

- citations must be explicit
- limitations must be stated
- absence of coverage must be disclosed

Ambiguous Canon references are invalid.

---

## Misuse of Citation

The following are **invalid** uses of citation:

- authority laundering
- rhetorical closure
- institutional shielding
- compliance signaling

Citation must not be weaponized.

---

## Binding Effect

This document is binding.

Any citation or quotation that violates these rules is invalid.
