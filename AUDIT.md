- all documents under `canon/`
- canonical hierarchy and ordering
- internal consistency and boundary integrity

Audit does not evaluate:

- correctness of ideas
- external applicability
- derivative interpretations

---

## Audit Criteria

The Core Canon was evaluated against the following criteria:

1. **Ontological completeness**

   - Canon defines what it is and what it is not
   - No dependency on repository mechanics or institutions

2. **Misuse resistance**

   - External capture vectors addressed
   - Internal misuse vectors addressed
   - Power, morality, intelligence, decision substitution prohibited

3. **Epistemic boundaries**

   - No factual, predictive, or epistemic claims
   - Explicit handling of silence and incompleteness

4. **Operational separation**

   - Clear boundary between Canon and derivatives
   - No governance or publishing rules embedded in Canon

5. **Hierarchical integrity**

   - No contradictions detected
   - Conflict resolution defined structurally
   - No interpretive balancing permitted

6. **Closure and stability**
   - Core Canon explicitly closed
   - Change mechanisms externalized
   - No incremental expansion allowed

## Findings

- No internal contradictions detected
- No scope leakage detected
- No governance or repo-level rules embedded in Canon
- Canonical hierarchy is intact
- Canonical boundaries are explicit and enforceable

---

## Exceptions

None identified.

## Conclusion

The System Momentum Core Canon satisfies all audit criteria for:

- structural integrity
- misuse resistance
- epistemic restraint
- long-term stability
