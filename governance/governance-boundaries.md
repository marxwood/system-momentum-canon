# Governance Boundaries

This document defines the **limits of governance authority** relative to the System Momentum Canon.

This document is **governance-level**.
It is **not canonical**.
It introduces no canonical meaning.

---

## Purpose

To prevent:

- governance creep
- soft authority escalation
- reinterpretation via process
- replacement of Canon by procedure

Governance exists to **constrain behavior**, not to define truth.

---

## Absolute Boundary

Governance **must not**:

- define canonical meaning
- interpret canonical content
- resolve canonical ambiguity
- override canonical structure
- introduce new canonical concepts

Any such attempt is invalid by definition.

---

## Canonical Supremacy

The Canon:

- precedes governance
- constrains governance
- cannot be modified by governance
- cannot be extended by governance

If governance conflicts with the Canon, governance yields.

---

## No Interpretive Authority

Governance documents:

- may describe rules
- may define obligations
- may constrain claims

They must not:

- explain what the Canon “really means”
- provide authoritative readings
- declare preferred interpretations

Interpretation belongs nowhere.

---

## Structural Isolation

Governance content must remain isolated in:

- `governance/`

It must not:

- appear inside `canon/`
- be referenced as canonical
- be included in canonical indexing

---

## Enforcement Limits

Governance:

- binds participants
- binds publications
- binds repositories

It does not:

- bind belief
- bind understanding
- bind interpretation

Compliance is procedural, not intellectual.

---

## Closure

This document closes the governance layer.

No additional governance documents may introduce authority beyond these boundaries.

---

## Binding Effect (Governance)

This document is binding for governance scope and practice.

It has no authority over `canon/`.
