# Validation Claims (Governance)

This document defines how **claims of validation, alignment, or compliance** with the System Momentum Canon may be made.

This document is **governance-level**.
It is **not canonical**.
It introduces no canonical meaning.

---

## Purpose

To prevent:

- false authority signals
- implicit certification
- capture of the Canon through validation language
- emergence of de-facto “approving bodies”

This governs _claims_, not truth.

---

## No Canonical Validation Authority

There is **no canonical authority** that can:

- validate systems
- certify compliance
- approve interpretations
- grant canonical alignment

The Canon validates nothing.
It only exists.

---

## Permitted Claims

The following claims are permitted **only if explicitly qualified**:

- “This system references the System Momentum Canon”
- “This work is informed by the Canon”
- “This implementation attempts alignment with the Canon”

Such claims must:

- name the claimant
- state non-equivalence
- avoid implication of approval

---

## Prohibited Claims

The following claims are invalid:

- “Canon-validated”
- “Canon-approved”
- “Officially compliant”
- “Certified by the Canon”
- “Canonical implementation”

No wording may imply authority transfer.

---

## Self-Assertion Only

All alignment or compliance claims are:

- self-asserted
- non-binding
- non-transferable

They carry no canonical weight.

---

## Public Endpoints

A public endpoint may exist to:

- publish self-asserted claims
- disclose scope and limitations
- provide transparency

Such endpoints must not:

- imply approval
- score compliance
- issue judgments
- act as gatekeepers

They are disclosure surfaces, not validators.

---

## Misrepresentation

Misuse of validation language constitutes:

- authority inflation
- canonical capture attempt
- derivative overreach

Such misuse invalidates the claim.

---

## Binding Effect (Governance)

This document is binding for:

- repositories
- publications
- services
- public statements

It has no authority over `canon/`.
