# Disclosure (Governance)

This document defines **mandatory disclosure rules** for any entity referencing, using, or claiming alignment with the System Momentum Canon.

This document is **governance-level**.
It is **not canonical**.
It introduces no canonical meaning.

---

## Purpose

To ensure that:

- Canon references are not misleading
- scope is not inflated
- authority is not implied
- omissions are not used as persuasion

Disclosure governs **honesty of presentation**, not correctness.

---

## Mandatory Disclosure Elements

Any public or internal reference to the Canon **must disclose**:

1. **Nature of use**

   - reference
   - inspiration
   - attempted alignment
   - partial adoption

2. **Scope**

   - which parts of the Canon are referenced
   - which parts are excluded or ignored

3. **Authority**
   - explicit statement that no canonical authority is held
   - explicit denial of validation or approval status

---

## Prohibited Omissions

The following omissions are invalid:

- hiding non-alignment
- implying completeness where none exists
- collapsing Canon and derivative
- failing to name the claimant

Silence is not neutrality when used to imply authority.

---

## Disclosure Surfaces

Disclosure must appear in at least one of:

- documentation
- public website
- repository metadata
- service description

Disclosure must be **reasonably accessible**.

---

## No Canonical Enforcement

Failure to disclose:

- does not invalidate the Canon
- does not trigger canonical response
- does invalidate the claim

The Canon does not police.
Governance constrains behavior.

---

## Binding Effect (Governance)

This document is binding for:

- publications
- repositories
- services
- public communications

It has no authority over `canon/`.
