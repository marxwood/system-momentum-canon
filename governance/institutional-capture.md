# Institutional Capture

This document prevents **institutional capture** of the System Momentum Canon.

Institutional capture occurs when organizations, bodies, or processes attempt to appropriate canonical authority or redefine canonical meaning.

---

## No Canonical Institutions

There are **no canonical institutions**.

No organization, foundation, committee, board, or council may claim:

- canonical status
- canonical representation
- canonical interpretation authority

The Canon does not belong to an institution.

---

## Institutional Realization Is Not Ownership

Institutional Realization:

- localizes judgment
- assigns responsibility
- enables correction

It does **not**:

- generate authority
- define truth
- own the Canon

Any institution claiming otherwise is invalid.

---

## Invalid Institutional Claims

The following claims are **invalid**:

- being “the official Canon body”
- being “the Canon foundation”
- acting “on behalf of the Canon”
- enforcing Canon compliance
- certifying alignment

No institutional success legitimizes such claims.

---

## Separation of Roles

Institutions may:

- adopt the Canon
- reference the Canon
- derive internal rules from the Canon

Institutions may not:

- reinterpret canonical meaning
- modify constraints
- override non-negotiables
- speak with canonical authority

---

## Capture Patterns

Common capture patterns include:

- governance committees redefining meaning
- proceduralization of canonical authority
- branding Canon alignment as legitimacy
- substituting institutional process for judgment

All capture patterns are prohibited.

---

## Consequence of Capture Attempts

Institutional capture attempts result in:

- invalidation of alignment claims
- loss of canonical standing
- explicit non-recognition

No remediation process is implied.

---

## Binding Effect

This document is binding.

Any institutional claim inconsistent with this policy is invalid.
