# Canonical Authority

This document defines **where canonical authority resides**, how it is exercised, and how it is protected.

Authority is a structural necessity.  
Without it, the Canon collapses into interpretation.

---

## Source of Authority

Canonical authority resides in the **Canon itself**, as authored and maintained by its designated custodian.

The Canon is not governed by:

- consensus
- committees
- voting
- institutional approval
- adoption metrics

Authority does not emerge from agreement.
It is asserted and constrained by structure.

---

## Custodianship

A single custodian holds responsibility for the Canon at any given time.

Custodianship implies:

- responsibility, not ownership
- obligation to preserve invariants
- duty to reject invalid extensions
- accountability for canonical integrity

Custodianship is not transferable by delegation.
It may only change by explicit declaration.

---

## Non-Democratic Nature

The Canon is **explicitly non-democratic**.

Democratic processes optimize for agreement.
The Canon optimizes for correctness.

Any attempt to subject the Canon to collective decision-making constitutes a category error.

---

## Authority vs. Power

Canonical authority is not power.

- It does not enforce behavior.
- It does not compel adoption.
- It does not punish deviation.

It defines validity.

Actors may ignore the Canon.
They may not redefine it.

## Invalid Claims of Authority

The following do **not** confer canonical authority:

- institutional position
- expertise
- credentials
- popularity
- implementation success
- moral alignment

No external success can retroactively legitimize a canonical violation.

---

## Forking and Derivatives

Forks of the Canon are permitted.

Forks:

- are non-canonical by definition
- may be useful
- may be superior for specific purposes

Forking does not weaken the Canon.
It preserves its clarity.

Only the original Canon defines canonical truth.

---

## Change Control

Changes to the Canon:

- must preserve invariants
- must not violate constraints
- must not introduce prohibited patterns

All changes are explicit.
There is no implicit evolution.

---

## Finality

Canonical authority is final within the scope of the Canon.

Disagreement does not invalidate authority.
Silence does not w
