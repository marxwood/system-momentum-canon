# Entry Surface (Governance)

This document defines the **repository and publication entry surface** for the System Momentum Canon.

This document is **governance-level**.
It is **not canonical**.
It introduces no canonical meaning and has no authority over `canon/`.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to:

- prevent repository surfaces from becoming alternative Canons
- prevent publication formats from redefining meaning
- constrain how claims of Canon reference and alignment are communicated

It governs communication, not truth.

---

## Canonical Source of Meaning

Canonical meaning exists only in:

- `canon/`

Canonical navigation exists only in:

- `canon/INDEX.md`

No other repository artifact carries canonical meaning.

---

## Repository Surfaces Are Non-Canonical

The following repository surfaces are **non-canonical**:

- `README.md`
- `MAP.md`
- repository description and metadata
- issues, pull requests, discussions
- commit messages
- release notes

They may describe the Canon.
They must not define or modify it.

---

## No Implicit Canonical Status

No text becomes canonical by:

- placement
- repetition
- convenience
- popularity
- citation frequency

Canonical status is explicit and confined to `canon/`.

---

## Publication Rule

Any public or internal publication referencing the Canon must:

- reference `canon/INDEX.md` as the canonical entry point
- avoid presenting summaries as canonical substitutes
- state that derivatives are non-canonical
- avoid language of certification or approval

Public descriptions must not collapse hierarchy.

---

## Misuse

The following are invalid:

- presenting README or MAP as canonical
- presenting a summary as “the Canon”
- implying canonical meaning through commentary
- treating issues/PRs as interpretation authority

Entry-surface confusion is a capture mechanism.

---

## Binding Effect (Governance)

This document is binding for repository governance and publication practice.

It has no authority to:

- redefine canonical meaning
- override canonical hierarchy
- expand canonical scope
